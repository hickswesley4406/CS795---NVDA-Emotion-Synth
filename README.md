# CS795---NVDA-Emotion-Synth
ODU CS795 NVDA Screen Reader w/ Emotion Synthesizer

This project is an assignment under ODU CS795 instructed by Professor Vikas and overseen by Mohan Sunkara.

In order to integrate these plugins to the user's NVDA build, the user must store the driver file into the 'Developer Scratch Pad Directory' by opening the NVDA Advanced Settings.  

Currently the most recently developed driver plugin is 'Eng5.py'. The user should download this file and import this file into the globalPlugins folder of the Developer Scratch Pad Directory.

The user should then reload plugins by accessing the tools menu of NVDA and clicking 'Reload Plugins'

After following these steps, the user should be able to press the NVDA modifier key and 'left arrow' to repeat the navigationObject with the proper voice modification indicating the target string emotion.
